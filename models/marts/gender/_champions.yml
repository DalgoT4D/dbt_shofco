      This table contains information on gender program champions, including their county, gender, national
      ID, site location, and statuses related to training and identification. It also tracks the dates
      these champions were trained and identified, and computes their current status and training/identification
      quarters. The data assists in understanding the distribution and status of champions within the
      program.
