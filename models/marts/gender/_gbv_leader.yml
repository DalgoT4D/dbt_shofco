      The "gbv_leader" table provides information about gender-based violence community leaders, including
      their identification and training status. It includes details such as national ID, active status,
      county, gender, and dates of identification and training. The table also evaluates the leaders'
      status based on their training and identification and identifies the quarters during which they
      were trained or identified. This data helps in tracking and managing GBV community leaders effectively.
